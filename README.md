# DiabetesDiagnosticMeasures

Provided by The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, we examine 768 female patients of Pima Indian heritage with the minimum age permitted being 21 years old. We utilize 7 variables in the diagnostic measures determining whether a patient has diabetes. Through looking for possible relationships among the variables and the dependent variable (YES or NO), we hope to gather further insights to improving the Diabetes response.
